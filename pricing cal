Detailed Output Computation
Row 1:

ABS(0.5) = 0.5, which is between 0 and 1.
ABS(1.5) = 1.5, which is greater than or equal to 1.
Therefore, the result is ROUND(ABS(1.5), 2) = 1.50.
Row 2:

ABS(0) = 0, which matches Condition 2.
Therefore, the result is 0.00.
Row 3:

Conditions 1 and 2 are not met.
Therefore, the result is ROUND(ABS(10)/ABS(2), 2) = 5.00.

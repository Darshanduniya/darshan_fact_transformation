Edited Sales: Let's say a customer purchases two laptops at $800 each. The total sales revenue from this transaction would be $1600.
Edited Units: In this scenario, two units of laptops were sold in the transaction.
Edited Inventory: Before this transaction, the store had 10 laptops in stock. After selling two laptops, the inventory level would be reduced to 8 units.
Sample Input:

Edited Sales: $1600
Edited Units: 2
Edited Inventory (before transaction): 10
Sample Output (after the transaction):

Edited Inventory: 8
This example illustrates how these columns work together:

Edited Sales shows the revenue generated from the sale.
Edited Units indicates the quantity of products sold.
Edited Inventory reflects the updated inventory level after the transaction, helping the retailer keep track of stock levels.
